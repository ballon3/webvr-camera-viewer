WebVR Camera Viewer
===

Stream live camera feeds into a virtual reality environment using WebRTC and WebVR.

The demo can be found here: http://emgeee.github.io/webvr-camera-viewer/

Click on the "stream" link to create a new room. Once the webcam feed is enabled, access the corresponding viewer link using a mobile phone with a Cardboard viewer or a WebVR enabled browser with an Occulus rift.

You can read more about the project over on the [blog post](https://greenin.space/streaming-video-in-webvr/).
